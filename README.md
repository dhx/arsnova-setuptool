# ARSnova

ARSnova is a modern approach to Audience Response Systems (ARS). It is released under the GPLv3 license and is offered as a Software as a Service free of charge. Head over to [arsnova.eu](https://arsnova.eu/) to see it in action.

This repository is used to initialize the database for ARSnova.

## Getting Started

The most convenient way to get started developing ARSnova is by using our [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) environment, found at [thm-projects/arsnova-vagrant](https://github.com/thm-projects/arsnova-vagrant). Use your IDE on your host machine to make changes to ARSnova, while the build process is completely handled by the Vagrant box. You will not need to install any development tools.

[arsnova-vagrant](https://github.com/thm-projects/arsnova-vagrant) sets up a virtual machine for both development and production use. The basic usage is `vagrant up`, which will start the development environment. If you wish to start production as well, use `vagrant up production`.

Once any machine has been started, all required ARSnova repositories are automatically cloned from GitHub, so that you can start coding immediately.

To connect to your development machine, type `vagrant ssh`. After that, you can start ARSnova inside the machine by running `./start.sh`. You can then access ARSnova from your host machine by opening http://localhost:8080.

### QA Private Build

[arsnova-vagrant](https://github.com/thm-projects/arsnova-vagrant) also sets up the build environment we use internally at THM, which consists of [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) and [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/). The former provides a QA pipeline that builds, tests, analyzes, and finally deploys ARSnova to the production environment. SonarQube is used for the analyzation phase and provides a drill-down into many quality aspects, including [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).

While the development environment is running, Jenkins and SonarQube are available at:

- http://localhost:9000 (SonarQube)
- http://localhost:9090 (Jenkins)

### QA Public Build

We also leverage the cloud provided by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) to build and test ARSnova. Travis first builds and unit tests the software, then it instructs Sauce Labs to run smoke tests on different browsers and operating systems. This ensures that the basic features of ARSnova work across browsers and platforms. See [this example](https://saucelabs.com/tests/4beecf8c754f418da0b75259c039c077) to get an idea.

Our official build status provided by Travis CI:

- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thm-projects/arsnova-backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thm-projects/arsnova-backend) for ARSnova Backend
- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thm-projects/arsnova-mobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thm-projects/arsnova-mobile) for ARSnova Mobile

## Usage

To create the database and to install or update the views, simply run:

	python tool.py

To migrate the database to a newer version run after every backend update:

	python migration.py

*Note:* This tool requires Python 2. Windows users have to make additional changes to the path used in file `tool.py`.
